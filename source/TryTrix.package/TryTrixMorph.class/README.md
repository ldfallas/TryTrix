I am a visual representation of a tetris-like game. I take input from the user and update the game state.

To  display an initial state of the game you can execute:

|tt|
tt := TryTrixMorph init.
tt openInWindow.

Internal Representation and Key Implementation Points.

    Instance Variables
	gameState:		<Object> the  state of the game
